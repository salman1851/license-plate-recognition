# license_plate_recognition
This program takes an image of a car as input and reads its license plate characters. 

The python files are part of the Ultralytics YOLOv5 (version 7.0) file system. After cloning the YOLOv5 repository and installing the requirements, these files need to be copied in the main folder. Then, run the following command in the terminal: "python read_license_plate.py sample_car.jpg". Replace the first argument of the command with your own test image.
